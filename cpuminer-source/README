Build instructions:
	./build.sh	# this script will install dependencies and build the miner for you.


Usage instructions:  Run "minerd --help" to see options.

Connecting through a proxy:  Use the --proxy option.
To use a SOCKS proxy, add a socks4:// or socks5:// prefix to the proxy host.
Protocols socks4a and socks5h, allowing remote name resolving, are also
available since libcurl 7.18.0.
If no protocol is specified, the proxy is assumed to be a HTTP proxy.
When the --proxy option is not used, the program honors the http_proxy
and all_proxy environment variables.
